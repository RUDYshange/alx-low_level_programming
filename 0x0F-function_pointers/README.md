C Function Pointers and Simple Programs
This document presents a set of tasks that focus on various aspects of C programming, including working with function pointers and implementing simple programs. Each task is clearly defined with its objectives and requirements. Let's dive into the details:

Task 0: What's My Name
Objective: Write a function that prints a name.

Prototype:

c
Copy code
void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));
Task 1: If You Spend Too Much Time Thinking About a Thing, You'll Never Get It Done
Objective: Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

Prototype:

c
Copy code
void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));
Task 2: To Hell With Circumstances; I Create Opportunities
Objective: Write a function that searches for an integer.

Prototype:

c
Copy code
int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));
Task 3: A Goal Is Not Always Meant to Be Reached; It Often Serves Simply as Something to Aim At
Objective: Write a program that performs simple operations.

Usage:

shell
Copy code
calc num1 operator num2
Where:

num1 and num2 are integers.
operator is one of the following:
+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
%: modulo
Requirements:

Handle various error conditions:
If the number of arguments is incorrect, print "Error" and exit with status 98.
If the operator is not one of the specified options, print "Error" and exit with status 99.
If division or modulo by 0 is attempted, print "Error" and exit with status 100.
Task Components:

3-calc.h: Contains function prototypes and data structures.
3-op_functions.c: Contains the five functions for performing operations.
3-get_op_func.c: Implements the function to select the correct operation based on the operator.
3-main.c: The main program logic.
Task 4: Most Hackers Are Young Because Young People Tend to Be Adaptable
Objective: Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

Usage:

shell
Copy code
./main number_of_bytes
Requirements:

The opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase.
Each opcode is two characters long.
The listing ends with a new line.
Handle error conditions:

If the number of arguments is incorrect, print "Error" and exit with status 1.
If the number of bytes is negative, print "Error" and exit with status 2.
These tasks provide opportunities to explore C programming concepts, including function pointers, data handling, and error management. Make sure to understand the objectives and requirements for each task before proceeding with the implementation.
